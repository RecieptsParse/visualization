# Dashboard for ReceiptParse
> This Dash Board displays how often people purchase particular items through displaying the categorization of receipt information based on vendor and product.

## About

As people purchase items from stores, there are often categories that people use when purchasing items or going to vendors. Therefore, through our visualization, we strive to uncover these findings. 

Our data was from the categorization of receipt information using conversion methodologies to a JSON and K-Nearest Neighbors found in our [OCR_to_JSON repository] (https://github.com/RecieptsParse/OCR_TO_JSON).

## Launch Dashboard

2. Navigate to vis.py
