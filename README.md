# Visualization for ReceiptParse
> Welcome to the final project visulization of ICS 438. Our group is made up of 4 members: Jeremiah Dy, Kylie Higashionna, Grayson Levy, Amanda Nitta.

## About

We created a parser to convert receipt data into structured JSON documents adhering to a specified schema utilizing ChatGPT4. We classified each receipt's vendor and products into predefined categories using a classification method from the FAISS library which employed K-Nearest Neighbors.
